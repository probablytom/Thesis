# RQ scratching

## Final draft (modification of what was agreed with Tim, added 19-11-23)

1. Is an aspect orientation tool which is appropriate for use in simulation &
   modelling feasible to design?
2. Can models of systems more accurately reflect their subjects through
   advice-based improvements?
3. Can advice be used to accurately introduce behaviours or parameters not
   originally present in a model?
4. As aspects are portable modules, can improvements to one model be woven into
   another without statistically significant loss of performance?

## 09-10-23 rework
1. Can changes to a model be represented as advice using aspect orientation?
2. Can a model be made more realistic by applying aspect-oriented improvements?
3. Can advice which improves the realism of a model be ported to others without
   loss of realism?

## Earlier scratching

1. Can we demonstrate that a model of human actors can be made realistic through
   aspect oriented behavioural variation (rather than breaking the model's
   representation of its domain)?
2. Can we demonstrate that our aspects represent real-world variation in actors'
   behaviour, rather than the emergent change to an overall system? (by
   clustering, we demonstrate that many people exhibit the _same_ changes, but
   not everybody does, i.e. the aspect accurately represents a subset of our
   modelled actors)
3. Can aspects applied successfully to one model be expected to see the same
   success when applied to other models?

Research questions found in an early .md file detailling the thesis structure:
- RQ: Can we fit model details per-player to get realistic player behaviour?
- RQ: Can we cluster based on accuracy of different models for each player?
- RQ: Can we generate predictive data for unseen models?

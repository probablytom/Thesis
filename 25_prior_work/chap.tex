% % related to this work (e.g. that masters thesis that models covid).

% % Some notes on where PDSF was before the PHD work, edited from the first draft
% % of the thesis.

% % \pdsf is a Python library~\cite{pdsf_repo}
% % built for making changes to the source code of a Python function as it is
% % called, and before it is executed, while the original function definition
% % remains oblivious to the changes being made. It was originally developed as an
% % honours-level dissertation, which was built upon and detailled in a subsequent
% % paper~\cite{wallis2018caise}. This thesis furthers that original work. To be
% % clear about the work this thesis contains, the state of the project
% % \emph{before} this work began is briefly discussed here.

% \pdsf is a Python library~\cite{pdsf_repo} which implements a dynamically-woven
% aspect orientation framework with the capacity to weave changes within a
% specified join point. It is designed primarily to address the needs discussed in
% \cref{sec:lit_discussion}, particularly those of aspect-oriented simulation and
% modelling.

% Work on PyDySoFu predates the work presented in this thesis: an early version
% was developed for the modelling of behavioural variation. This prototype was
% redeveloped and improved to provide more suitable tooling for more complex
% experiments, and to better address the requirements of such a tool and
% opportunities found in the existing literature. \pdsf{}'s improved design and
% implementation is discussed in \cref{chap:pdsf_rewrite}. 

% In this chapter, prior work on \pdsf{} and the research conducted with it is
% reviewed, so as to isolate the contributions presented in this thesis from
% previously published research.

% \subsection{Motivations for \pdsf{}'s Original Development}

% The original incarnation of \pdsf{} was developed with different motivations
% than those outlined in \cref{chap:lit_review}. It is therefore important to
% elucidate the context in which it was designed and developed.

% \pdsf{} was originally developed for the representation of behavioural variance
% in sociotechnical systems, and was first produced as a proof-of-concept; the
% core contribution was one of tooling. It was developed for use in Python
% codebases, by virtue of the language's widespread use and its flexibility in its
% modelling of data and process.

% The original version of the tool was to be applied to models of behaviour in
% \sociotechnical systems, where individual actions were represented as functions.
% Actions which could be decomposed further into more granular actions were to be
% defined as a functions calling their more granular counterpart functions.
% Invocations of low-level behaviours would implement some change to an
% environment in the model which its modelled behaviour would be expected to
% incur. Invocations of high-level behaviours, containing the invocations of
% lower-level behaviours they compose in the model, would therefore apply the
% combined effect of the collected behaviours they represent. A benefit of this
% approach to modelling behaviour was that high-level behaviours could implement
% the ``flow'' of a behaviour. For example, a behaviour which would be modelled in
% a flowchart as having some loop could be modelled analogously in the method
% described through use of primitive control flow operators in Python, such as
% \lstinline{for} and \lstinline{while} loops.

% Another benefit of this approach is that the behaviours modelled have a
% predictable structure which is amenable to metaprogramming. A low-level
% behaviour's affect could be changed by changing the function definition; more
% structural changes could be made by altering the flow of less granular
% behaviours. A simple high-level behaviour containing a series of function
% invocations (modelling an ordered list of steps in the \sociotechnical system)
% can be represented as a literal list of function calls. The contents of such a
% list is trivially modifiable. Removing an item from a list or truncating it at a
% certain length, for example, are both achievable in a trivial manner using
% high-level languages such as Python. Notably, many behaviours can be conceived
% of which could be represented as high-level behaviours but would not be amenable
% to a simple list of more granular behaviours, such as a behaviour with a looping
% quality. 

% With a mechanism to rewrite either an implementation of a behaviour or a
% collection of behaviours (in the less granular functions mentioned), modelling
% in such a fashion could therefore lend itself to semantically simple
% metaprogramming that could represent real-world variations in behaviour.
% However, largely for reasons discussed in \cref{sec:variation_sm_motivations},
% metaprogramming for representing realistic behavioural variations in
% \sociotechnical simulations should be able to take advantage of system state.
% Many real-world behaviours are contingent on environmental state. Real-world
% actors in \sociotechnical systems might become tired after lots of work, or
% proportionally to time of day within a simulation. Therefore, the
% metaprogramming as described should be performed during runtime, for which no
% suitable candidate was available. \pdsf was developed to fulfil this
% requirement, so that behavioural variance in \sociotechnical simulation could be
% modelled as described and subsequently studied.

% \section{\pdsf{}'s Implementation and Features}

% % The original implementation of \pdsf patched Python classes with
% % additional functionality. Attributes of Python objects are usually retrieved using
% % dot notation (i.e. \lstinline{object_id.attr_id}), which evaluates internally to
% % a call to \lstinline{object_class.__getattribute__(``attr_id'')}. PyDySoFu replaces a
% % class' built-in \lstinline{__getattribute__()} method with a new one, which
% % calls the original to acquire the required attribute. 

% Aspect orientation's core concepts include join points, aspects, and advice.
% \pdsf was not originally designed with aspect orientation in mind --- though its
% design aligned with aspect oriented design in many ways --- and implemented
% \emph{analogues} of these concepts using fundamental Python concepts. In
% particular, it used Python's decorators to specify join points (and the advice
% to be applied to them). The intended use of \pdsf{}'s original implementation
% was that a decorator, called \lstinline{@fuzz()}, could be used to annotate a
% function which might undergo variation at runtime.

% \revnote{Add some diagrams here for a high-level description of the procedure that happens when a variation is applied.}

% \labelledsubsec{Python Decorators}{decorators_explained}

% Python decorators annotate function definitions. They are also
% functions\footnote{Decorators can also be defined in other ways, such as
% callable classes, but this is unimportant for the explanation at hand. While it
% is a simplification of the technical details of Python decorators, for the
% purpose of a clear example we will consider decorators to be functions
% specifically.}, which accept a function as an argument and return a function.
% Decorators transform the functions they annotate: any function with a decorator
% applied to its definition is passed to that decorator as an argument immediately
% after compilation. The function returned by the decorator is used as the final
% value of the original function's compilation, i.e. when compiling a function
% \lstinline{f} annotated by a decorator \lstinline{d}, the value referenced by
% the symbol ``\lstinline{f}'' is \lstinline{d(f)}.

% \begin{figure}[h]\label{decorator_simple_explanation}
%     \begin{center}
%         \begin{lstlisting}
% def example_decorator(annotated_func):
%     def _wrapped_func(*args, **kwargs):
%         print("Running a decorated function")
%         to_return = annotated_func(*args, **kwargs)
%         print("Decorated function has returned")
%         return to_return
%     return _wrapped_func

% @example_decorator
% def add(a, b):
%     return a + b

% print(add(5, 6))
%         \end{lstlisting}
%     \end{center}
%     \caption{Python code implementing a simple decorator.}
% \end{figure}


% \Cref{decorator_simple_explanation} contains a simple example, where the
% function \lstinline{add} is annotated by a decorator, called
% \lstinline{example_decorator}. The relevant compilation and execution steps of
% running the code outlined in the \cref{decorator_simple_explanation} is as
% follows:

% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item The first function definition, \lstinline{example_decorator}, is
%     compiled and the resulting function object is placed in the variable
%     namespace as ``\lstinline{example_decorator}''.
%     \item \lstinline{add} is compiled, producing a function object. However,
%     this function object is not the object which is eventually available in the
%     variable namespace as the symbol, ``\lstinline{add}'', because its
%     definition is annotated by \lstinline{@example_decorator}.
%     \item \lstinline{example_decorator} is invoked, and the argument it is
%     passed is the function object compiled in step \pointno{2}.
%     \item Executing \lstinline{example_decorator} produces another function
%     object, named ``\lstinline{_wrapped_func}'' in the local namespace, and
%     returned. When executed, this function will print
%     ``\lstinline{Running a decorated function}'',
%     executes the function ``\lstinline{annotated_func}''
%     (which is \lstinline{add} in this invocation), and finally prints
%     ``\lstinline{Decorated function has returned}'', preserving and returning
%     the values returned by the invocation to \lstinline{annotated_func} (here
%     \lstinline{add}). Note that all arguments to \lstinline{_wrapped_func} are
%     passed to \lstinline{annotated_func} (here \lstinline{add}), meaning that
%     the function object produced in this process is agnostic as to the arguments
%     it is invoked with.
%     \item When the decorator returns, the compilation of \lstinline{add} is
%     complete. The function object returned by the decorator,
%     \lstinline{_wrapped_func}, is added to the namespace as the symbol
%     ``\lstinline{add}''. Future references to ``\lstinline{add}'' will resolve
%     to this function object.
%     \item In the final line, when \lstinline{add} is called, the function
%     object \lstinline{_wrapped_func} is invoked with the arguments \lstinline{5}
%     and \lstinline{6}. It outputs:\inline{Fix blockquote formatting} \begin{blockquote}
%     Running a decorated function
%     Decorated function has returned
%     11
%     \end{blockquote}
% \end{enumerate}

% Python decorators can be used to append functionality to the beginning or end of
% a function invocation by adding business logic in place of the first and second
% print statements within \lstinline{_wrapped_func} respectively. However, if the
% function provided as an argument could be rewritten, and the rewritten function
% returned, then the returned function would literally be a variation of the one
% the decorator was applied to. Using this mechanism, the original incarnation of
% \pdsf can introduce \emph{procedural} variance into a program. When applied to a
% model of behaviour as previously described, procedures model behaviours, making
% procedural variance \emph{behavioural} variance also. 

% \labelledsubsec{The \atfuzz decorator}{early-pdsf-fuzz-decorator}

% \revnote{\atfuzz isn't the version used in the caise paper, so this is pretty irrelevant. Replace with something more substantial around weaving with e.g. fuzz\_clazz.}
% To introduce behavioural variance with an effect that is contingent on model
% state at runtime, \atfuzz works with two more complex details about Python
% decorators.

% \inline{expand}
% First, \atfuzz is a function which \emph{generates} a decorator.

% \inline{expand}
% Second, the parameter \atfuzz accepts represents the variance to be applied, as
% previously mentioned.

% \inline{expand}
% The combination of these two factors allows for the introduction of procedural
% variance contingent on model state. Because this procedural variance can be
% applied to procedures representing behaviour in a structured and predictable
% manner, \atfuzz can also be used to represent behavioural variance in a model.

% %% ==== MARK
% %% Everything below this is from the original draft of the thesis. Leaving it
% % here to assist in redrafting. 



% % The variation to be applied was represented as a function
% % which took a list of ``steps'' and returned a new list of those steps, represent

% In the case where the required attribute is not callable, the value is returned
% as normal. Callable attributes are modified, however. In this case, the
% replacement \lstinline{__getattribute__()} also checks for a set of
% manipulations to make to the original code. These can be applied before or after
% the original code is run, as well as around it. A new function is returned
% containing a reference to the originally sought attribute, but which will search
% for these additional pieces of work before executing it, and can execute this
% work before or after the call (or both). These pieces of work are referred to as
% ``advice'', adopting aspect orientation terminology.

% As discussed further in \cref{subsec:pdsf_aop}, this approach is effectively an
% implementation of a traditional aspect orientation framework. However, unlike
% existing frameworks, PyDySoFu also supports a special kind of ``around'' advice:
% before a function is called, it can be rewritten. This is done by applying
% ``before'' advice which retrieves the abstract syntax tree of the target
% callable attribute using Python's \lstinline{inspect} module (its built-in
% reflection), applying arbitrary transformations to the tree, and recompiling it
% into a Python \lstinline{code} object (its representation of its
% internal bytecode). At this point, many things are possible: the transformation
% can be cached for later use, can replace the original callable's
% \lstinline{code} object to make the transformation persistent, or can be
% discarded after use. This transformed code is run in lieu of the original,
% effectively enabling aspect orientation which can make adaptations \emph{inside}
% a procedure as well as before and after its execution.

% This approach also had some limitations:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Traditional pointcuts cannot target points inside a procedure, meaning
%     that an aspect applied ``inside'' its target must manage the points where
%     its transformation is applied manually.
%     \item Importantly, a callable object's internal bytecode cannot be replaced
%     in Python3, leading to a rewrite discussed in \cref{chap:pdsf_rewrite}.
%     \item This method is significantly slower than other aspect orientation
%     approaches, as rewriting a class' \lstinline{__getattribute__} method means
%     that \emph{every} resolution of an object's attributes --- whether they are
%     methods or values, and including a class' built-in ``magic'' methods ---
%     incurs an overhead from the replaced \lstinline{__getattribute__}
%     implementation. However slight this overhead can be made, affecting Python's
%     built-in methods on classes means that rewriting the
%     \lstinline{__getattribute__} method is unavoidably expensive due to the
%     scale of these methods' use.
% \end{itemize}

% However, the goal of the original research was to develop a flexible
% ``proof-of-concept'' of aspect orientation adapting procedure definition at
% runtime, which was successfully
% achieved\cite{wallis2018caise,wallis2018genetic}. 

% \subsection{Aspect Orientation \& PyDySoFu}\label{subsec:pdsf_aop}

% The goals of ``changing a function's behaviour'' and maintaining
% ``obliviousness'' in the original definition of that function speak to the goals
% of the aspect oriented programming paradigm\cite{kiczales1997aspect}. Quoting
% their original definitions:

% \begin{displayquote}
%     Components are properties of a system, for which the implementation can be
%     cleanly encapsulated in a generalized procedure. Aspects are properties
%     for which the implementation cannot be cleanly encapsulated in a
%     generalized procedure. Aspects and cross-cut components cross-cut each other
%     in a system’s implementation.
%     [ \ldots{} ]
%     The key difference between
%     AOP and other approaches is that AOP provides component and aspect languages
%     with different abstraction and composition mechanisms.
% \end{displayquote}

% Generally, aspect orientation is percieved to be a technique for separation of
% concerns. Any cross-cutting concerns can be separated from their components into
% aspects applied where that concern arises. The strength of aspect orientation
% lies in its compositional nature: developers can write short, maintainable
% implementations of a procedure's core purpose (for example, business logic) and
% ancillary concerns such as logging or security can be woven into this
% implementation as preprocessing, compilation, or at runtime. This compositional
% nature is what gives rise to aspect orientation's ``obliviousness'', as the
% procedure targetted by a piece of advice is written without regard to that fact.

% The original PyDySoFu implementation was an aspect orientation library focusing
% on separating a function's definition from \emph{potential changes to it}. This
% was used to model ``contingent behaviour'' --- behaviour sensitive to some
% condition --- as an original, ``idealised'' definition of that behaviour, plus
% some possible alterations. These changes might apply to many different
% behaviours in the same manner, and therefore represent concerns which separate
% cleanly into an aspect. An example would be the behaviour of a worker whose job
% requires focus on allocated tasks. A lack of focus could be represented as steps
% of the worker's tasks being executed in duplicate, out-of-order, or skipped.
% Assuming aspects as described by \citeauthor{kiczales1997aspect} are able to
% edit the definition or execution of a procedure\footnote{As opposed to simply
% wrapping it with additional behaviour before and/or after execution}, such
% contingent behaviours are well modelled as aspects.

% To achieve this, a model was presented in \cite{wallis2018caise} wherein aspects
% were developed which could change function \emph{definitions} on each invocation
% of that function, contingent on program state. This allowed behavioural
% adaptation to be simulated in an aspect-oriented fashion. In addition, a library
% of behavioural adaptations called FUZZI-MOSS\inline{CITECITECITE} was developed
% which implemented many cross-cutting, contingent behaviours in procedural
% simulations of \sociotechnical systems.

% One important contribution of this work is that PDSF aspects are effectively
% able to operate \emph{inside} a target. In typical aspect orientation frameworks
% such as AspectJ~\cite{aspectj_intro}, aspects operate by effectively prepending
% or appending work to a target, referred to as ``before'' or ``after'' pointcuts
% respectively. To do both is referred to as ``around''. By manipulating
% procedures within Python directly, PDSF is able to manipulate its target from a
% new perspective, adding (or removing) work during the target's
% execution\footnote{Similarly to \cref{subsec:bca}, but in an aspect oriented
% manner.}. Moreover, because weaving is performed dynamically, every execution of
% a function may perform different operations.

% % change to a comparison between this and the lit, what are the limitations of
% % this approach, etc.
% \subsection{Opportunities presented by PyDySoFu}

% PyDySoFu presented several oppportunities for future research. Some salient
% properties of the original work include:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item It provided an aspect orientation library which could weave and
%     unweave aspects during program execution, without relying on anything other
%     than Python's built-in language features. As discussed in
%     \cref{sec:dynamic_aop_review}, this is supported by some early aspect
%     orientation frameworks also, but AspectJ dominates in the world of aspect
%     orientation frameworks and does not support weaving during program execution.
%     \item It provided the capacity to weave aspects \emph{inside} targets, as
%     opposed to around them, or at either end of their execution. So far as we
%     are aware, no aspect orientation framework in research or industry has
%     offered this feature, and its applications and potential are yet to be
%     explored.
%     \item Relatedly, PyDySoFu was used in the context of simulating behaviour which may change
%     over time. Contingent behaviour being a cross-cutting concern is an
%     innovation of the early research which suggests aspect orientation may have
%     strong applications in \sociotechnical simulation \& modelling.
% \end{itemize}

% \inline{Do we need a brief explainer of what aspect orientation is before
% jumping into outside lit? Or will this go in the introduction? already a little
% in the earlier litrev subsections.}

% The amount of potential investigation which can be done into the dynamic weaving
% of target-altering / ``inside'' aspects in simulation \& modelling applications
% is vast. While literature on the complete topic is absent, each individual
% component of this research angle is well-studied on its own. These opportunities
% might be related to existing literature through the following questions:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item How does PyDySoFu compare to existing aspect orientation frameworks,
%     particularly those with a focus on dynamic weaving? Related frameworks are
%     summarised and compared in \cref{sec:dynamic_aop_review}.

%     \item What is the use of aspect orientation in simulation \& modelling? How
%     does the approach taken in \pdsf's prior work relate to existing
%     approaches? This will be discussed for simulation in
%     \cref{sec:ao_and_simulation}, and for modelling in
%     \cref{sec:ao_and_modelling}.
    
%     \item Variability is important to capture in any \sociotechnical model or
%     simulation. How is variability treated in existing literature, and how does
%     this relate to \pdsf's approach? This will be explored in
%     \cref{sec:dynamism_in_sm}.
% \end{itemize}




% % ==== MARK Second rework, with caise-version of pdsf.

% \pdsf is a Python library~\cite{pdsf_repo} which implements a dynamically-woven
% aspect orientation framework with the capacity to weave changes within a
% specified join point. It is designed primarily to address the needs discussed in
% \cref{sec:lit_discussion}, particularly those of aspect-oriented simulation and
% modelling.

% Work on PyDySoFu predates the work presented in this thesis: an early version

% In this chapter, prior work on \pdsf{} and the research conducted with it is
% reviewed, so as to isolate the contributions presented in this thesis from
% previously published research.

An implementation of the main tool developed and used in this thesis, ``\pdsf'',
predates this thesis. As context for the contributions in this thesis, this
chapter will describe the state of the project before the presented research was
undertaken. Motivations for the tool's original development are described in
\cref{sec:pdsf_motivations}, which are followed by its design and implementation
in \cref{sec:prior_work_pdsf}, and that of related tooling for experiments and
simulations in \cref{sec:prior_work_machinery}. The chapter concludes with a
description of the research undertaken using these tools in
\cref{sec:caise_paper}, as some results in the representation of behavioural
variance using aspect orientation were found using these tools which predate
this thesis and offer important background for the research undertaken in it.

\labelledsec{Motivations in originally implementing \pdsf}{pdsf_motivations}

The original incarnation of \pdsf{} was developed with different motivations
than those outlined in \cref{chap:lit_review}. It is therefore important to
elucidate the context in which it was designed and developed.

\pdsf{} was originally developed for the representation of behavioural variance
in sociotechnical systems, and was first produced as a proof-of-concept; the
core contribution was one of tooling. It was developed for use in Python
codebases, by virtue of the language's widespread use and its flexibility in its
modelling of data and process.

The original version of the tool was to be applied to models of behaviour in
\sociotechnical systems, where individual actions were represented as functions.
Actions which could be decomposed further into more granular actions were to be
defined as functions with calls to invoke their more granular counterpart
functions. Invocations of low-level behaviours would implement some change to an
environment in the model which its modelled behaviour would be expected to
incur. Invocations of high-level behaviours, containing the invocations of
lower-level behaviours they compose in the model, would therefore apply the
combined effect of the collected behaviours they represent. A benefit of this
approach to modelling behaviour was that high-level behaviours could implement
the ``flow'' of a behaviour. For example, a behaviour which would be modelled in
a flowchart as having some loop could be modelled analogously in the method
described through use of primitive control flow operators in Python, such as
\lstinline{for} and \lstinline{while} loops.

Another benefit of this approach is that the behaviours modelled have a
predictable structure which is amenable to metaprogramming. A low-level
behaviour's affect could be changed by changing the function definition; more
structural changes could be made by altering the flow of less granular
behaviours. A simple high-level behaviour containing a series of function
invocations (modelling an ordered list of steps in the \sociotechnical system)
can be represented as a literal list of function calls. The contents of such a
list is trivially modifiable. Removing an item from a list or truncating it at a
certain length, for example, are both achievable in a trivial manner using
high-level languages such as Python. Notably, many behaviours can be conceived
of which could be represented as high-level behaviours but would not be amenable
to a simple list of more granular behaviours, such as a behaviour with a looping
quality. 

With a mechanism to rewrite either an implementation of a behaviour or a
collection of behaviours (in the less granular functions mentioned), modelling
in such a fashion could therefore lend itself to semantically simple
metaprogramming that could represent real-world variations in behaviour.
However, largely for reasons discussed in \cref{sec:variation_sm_motivations},
metaprogramming for representing realistic behavioural variations in
\sociotechnical simulations should be able to take advantage of system state.
Many real-world behaviours are contingent on environmental state. Real-world
actors in \sociotechnical systems might become tired after lots of work, or
proportionally to time of day within a simulation. Therefore, the
metaprogramming as described should be performed during runtime, for which no
suitable candidate was available. \pdsf was developed to fulfil this
requirement, so that behavioural variance in \sociotechnical simulation could be
modelled as described and subsequently studied.



\labelledsec{Original \pdsf Implementation}{prior_work_pdsf}

To disambiguate the improvements made to the original \pdsf implementation
in the tooling contributions of this thesis --- and to explain the fundamental
concepts involved in both implementations' approaches to aspect orientation and
the application of behavioural variance --- the implementation of the original
\pdsf tool, which predates the work presented in this thesis, is described here.



\labelledsubsec{Weaving mechanism}{prior_work_weaving}
The original \pdsf implementation made use of a weaving mechanism which could be
categorised as ``total weaving'' in the parlance of
\citeauthor{dynamicAOchitchyan}~\cite{dynamicAOchitchyan}: hooks to apply advice
are woven into every possible join point. The library was implemented in Python,
which offers a flexible object model \pdsf is able to take advantage of in order
to weave its hooks.

Python's object model has three key properties which the original implementation
of \pdsf takes advantage of:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Everything in Python is an object, including types, functions, and
    classes
    \item Objects are, in essence, implemented as a dictionary\footnote{Python's
    name for what other languages might call a \lstinline{map} or
    \lstinline{hashmap}.} with string keys. All attributes of an object --- such
    as a method on an instance of a class --- are values in this dictionary, and
    their identifiers are the string keys of the dictionary. In essence,
    \lstinline{someObject.val} is notionally equivalent to
    \lstinline{someObject.__dict__['val']}, though the subtleties of this
    mechanism will be explained later.
    \item Operations on objects are handled by ``magic methods'', which are
    specifically named methods on objects which Python calls for fundamental
    behaviour in the language. For example, \lstinline{objA == objB} is
    interpreted by Python as \lstinline{objA.__eq__(objB)}. Other built-in
    behaviours in Python have similar reserved method names which represent the
    implementation of some behaviour. These methods can be overridden, or
    specified by a programmer if they wish.
\end{enumerate}

\pdsf weaves aspect hooks into classes by taking advantage of these three
properties of Python. At a high level, \pdsf operates by replacing the
\lstinline{__getattribute__()} method of a class object with a custom one.
\lstinline{__getattribute__()} is the magic method responsible for performing
lookups in an object's underlying dictionary. The replacement
\lstinline{__getattribute__()} also looks up attributes in the relevant object's
underlying dictionary, but it also searches for advice to be applied when
performing these lookups, and applies any advice it finds. The replacement
\lstinline{__getattribute__()} method represents the aspect hooks woven by
\pdsf{}.

Hooks are applied to a class by way of an invocation to a function,
\lstinline{fuzz_clazz}, which takes a class as a parameter and weaves aspect
hooks into that class. \inline{Add citation for pdsf, asp}
\lstinline{fuzz_clazz} replaces the \lstinline{__getattribute__()} method of the
class with a new function object which it constructs. The replacement function
object operates 

More specifically, the replacement \lstinline{__getattribute__()} method makes a
call to the class' original \lstinline{__getattribute__()} method to retrieve
an attribute when required. If this attribute is not a function or method, it
is returned by the woven \lstinline{__getattribute__()} function and the program
affected class behaves as if it was never altered. If an attribute to be
retrieved is a method or function, however, a new function is constructed to be
returned. This function 

% All methods on an affected class are therefore
% retrieved through this codepath when executed.

\chapter{Future Work}\label{chap:future_work}

The focus of this thesis is to develop a state-of-the-art aspect-oriented
framework, to produce a suitable experimental environment to demonstrate its
effectiveness, and to use that environment to investigate whether aspect
orientation can be used to augment models with behavioural variance. \inline{is
suitable for simulation purposes? It's about showing that we \emph{can} use
aspect orientation appropriately in simulation environments, and that aspect
orientation can also lead us to realistic and nuanced simulations, too. Go back
through the pdsf and lit review chapters to make this argument properly.}. We
have found that aspect orientation can be used to create realistic and nuanced
simulations, have successfully produced a well-constrained environment to
simulate for testing purposes, and have produced a novel aspect orientation
framework which demonstrates novel and powerful weaving concepts; lots of
opportunities for research outwith this thesis' scope present themselves.

This chapter describes some possibilities for the presented research to be
extended in the future.

\subsection{Aspect-Oriented Metaprogramming in real-world Software Engineering}
\label{subsec:aspect_oriented_metaprogramming}

The combination of metaprogramming and aspect-orientation introduces powerful
new possibilities in the realm of aspect-orientation. In traditional
aspect-oriented work, aspects treat their targets as black boxes; this leads to
some limitations, which aspect-oriented metaprogramming is well positioned to address.

Traditional aspects cannot add their behavioural modifications interspersed
within the work being done by their target. The ``textbook'' use-case for
aspect-orientation is logging: aspects can separate logging from the business
logic they are applied to. However, a programmer in mainstream programming
paradigms may wish to insert logging behaviour \emph{within} their business
logic, rather than \emph{around} it. Aspect-oriented metaprogramming makes this
possible, as the target can have logging logic interspersed through otherwise
decoupled business logic when woven. To achieve this end goal without
``within''-style aspect application would require a refactoring of business
logic to create join points which traditional aspects could apply against; this
breaks the ``obliviousness'' property of the aspect orientated philosophy as
discussed in \cref{chap:lit_review}.


\inline{These were originally written as separate points, but they shouldn't be. Rework the preceding and following paragraphs so they read like a series of points as to the opportunities aomp \& \pdsf make available.}\inline{Maybe this whole thing's just one subsection? Maybe it should live under a single [section] heading?}    

Another example of this technique's applicability in a variety of real-world
situations is that traditional aspects cannot make decisions based on reflection
on specific properties of the code they are being applied to. This could include
calculations made, data accessed, or computational complexity as examples. A
concrete example would be the compilation of Python code for efficient
performance on a GPU (redirected from the CPU)~\cite{dejice2020thesis}, which is
achieved via a JIT compiler which optimises looping logic for parallel execution
on a GPU. Similar optimisations could be made through the analysis of common
codepaths and profiling of expensive parts of those codepaths, and the automated
optimisation of them. Research projects are also enabled which do not require
any optimisation heuristics or logic: as \pdsf makes both the target of aspect
application and the arguments passed to that target visible, it enables
instrumentation of programs\footnote{In a similar manner to the instrumentation
of RPGLite mdoels in \cref{subsec:aspects_instrumenting_model}.} to identify ---
for example --- whether arguments with certain properties cause slowdowns on a
codebase. In a hypothetical situation where a codebase was extremely performant
on a dataset except when processing frames of the dataset containing prime
numbers, isolating data causing worst-case performance and either automatically
analysing it or presenting it for a researcher's analysis could be a useful
feature for resource-constrained RSE teams, or as a built-in feature of
profilers.

Aspects with metaprogramming directly support reflection, as access to the
target's AST is provided as a feature of the technique, and allow transformed
code to be compiled just-in-time, which directly enables research projects such
as these. A study of the utility of the aspect-oriented metaprogramming approach
would support the development of these tools and techniques.


\section{Future Work pertaining to Aspect-Oriented Simulation}\label{sec:future_work_simulations}

This thesis has described novel techniques augmenting models with new features
and behaviours, and does so in an aspect-oriented manner. The potential for
improving simulations and models using aspect orientation has already been
discussed (most notably by \citeauthor{gulyas1999use}~\cite{gulyas1999use} as
discussed in \cref{ao_and_modelling}); however, \pdsf and aspect-oriented
metaprogramming present new opportunities in the field. This section discussed
avenues for future research which \pdsf enables.


\subsection{Augmentation of pre-existing models}

Myriad models exist which have been provided accurate results in past research,
but where unexpected events such as financial collapses, pandemics, or
unpredictable weather events cause one-off shifts in real-world data which
cannot be accounted for. For example, models of world health over time could not
account for the Covid19 pandemic, and models of the world economy could not
incorporate real-world data from the recession caused by responses to the
pandemic, or the 2008 financial crisis. The World3 model is an example of one
which has provided accurate predictions for decades\inline{Find citations for
World3 model}, but could not account for unexpected incidents when constructed.

Models are often initialised with data describing a system's initial state,
which may lead to correct predictions prior to a large event. Future predictions
could only represent the impact of a large, unpredictable event within the
system as changes to data or process; changing either for the entire model risks
compromising a model's predictive quality for the timespan prior to an event.
The modification must therefore be represented as a special case within the
model, leading to ancillary code inline with the model's core logic in a similar
manner to the scattered and tangled code discussed in
\cref{lit_review_AOP_explainer}, which aspect orientation was initially designed
to alleviate. It therefore has similar properties to a cross-cutting
concern~\cite{kiczales1997aspect} and may be suitable for factoring out of a
model's logic and into advice.

A relevant research question which future work could address is:

\begin{researchquestion}
Can aspect orientation be used to introduce special cases to real-world systems
to correct a model's predictions in when a system under research is altered by a
freak event?
\end{researchquestion}

what to replace it with.}

\subsection{Aspect Orientation's utility for Research Software Engineers}

The resource constraints and stringent requirements for accuracy in research
codebases also present challenges which augmentation through aspects could
assist with. Compensating for a special case in a pre-existing model would
require maintenance of the codebase, which takes time and could inadvertently
alter its behaviour. Time is a scarce resource in research environments, and
undesired changes to a model's behaviour can invalidate research results. An
alternative to adjusting the models directly is to construct aspects which
represent large and unpredictable events in real-world systems such as
pandemics, economic crises, war and famine. These can be modelled on real-world
data for accuracy, which can produce realistic simulations as this thesis
demonstrates. This use of aspect orientation in simulation and modelling can be
investigated by creating a proof-of-concept of the approach as applied to
pre-existing models.\footnote{This approach is similar to \pdsf{}'s initial
proof-of-concept study~\cite{wallis2018caise} as discussed in
\cref{chap:prior_work}.} Studies can also be conducted to investigate
whether an aspectually-augmented model is quicker to construct and easier to
maintain in future than a codebase with ``patches'' written into its original
logic.

Researchers investigating this technique's application to existing models could
also investigate the difficulties of augmenting a model created with no
intention of weaving advice in the future. The construction of advice requires
appropriate join points to be specified, and codebases which are structured in a
way which doesn't yield convenient join points might be more complex to augment
aspectually. These cases raise another use-case of \pdsf{}'s ``within''-style
weaving through runtime metaprogramming: where other aspect orientation
frameworks force aspects to treat the targets they are invoked on as
black-boxes, \pdsf can make modifications within them. \pdsf{}'s new kinds of
aspects may therefore be more useful than those in other frameworks for
researchers responsible for maintaining codebases written with no consideration
for join-point specification, and would therefore be more universally
applicable; this possibility requires future investigation.

If the research described successfully shows that aspectually-augmented
simulations are easier and quicker for an RSE to maintain and deliver than
direct maintenance of the model's codebase, then augmentation of existing models
to improve their accuracy can follow in the community.
\revnote{If I've got time, I'd love to push my codebase augmenting a World3
model to achieve just this with predictive implications for the 2008 financial
crisis and the covid pandemic.}
    
% ==== also wrote the below in another section and realised it's acutally about
% this point. I'd already finished this subsec, but leaving below in case I want
% to use it later.


% Relatedly, model features can be added as extensions through aspect
% orientation with the possibility of lower maintenance cost and increased
% flexibility. By way of illustration, consider researchers investigating a
% car's structural integrity in a collision, and suppose that they can create
% models of physical objects interacting. A scenario might arise where the
% precise mechanics of a car's structural change under impact may be poorly
% understood; many hypotheses may exist as how crumple zones made of a certain
% material absorb an impact and morph under its force. In this scenario, the
% task of the researchers might be to investigate different designs of their car
% to optimise crumple zone performance. Many models could be produced; one for
% each crumple zone. A model could also be constructed with parameterised
% properties of the car, allowing one codebase to consolidate several models.
% However, these parameters are likely to relate to the research at hand; to
% parameterise unnecessary components of the model adds complexity and spends
% development time for no clear gain. Future research projects may investigate
% model components which were not parameterised in the model's initial design.
% This raises a problem: how can the development team work to re-use the model
% while minimising maintenance cost?

% A solution is to add additional parameters as aspects. As aspect orientation
% frameworks supporting within-style changes can make arbitrary changes to the
% codebase, modifications can be made which leave the original model intact, but
% produce an additional model by using aspect orientation as to ``patch'' the
% original. If, in the future, extensions are required for either the original
% model or its extended version, aspects can be added to either. The logical
% conclusion of the design is that all model features could be implemented as
% sets of aspects adding functionality to a simple base model, and a model
% suitable for any piece of work can be constructed by composing relevant model
% components (weaving relevant aspects), extending functionality by adding a new
% behaviour to the set of available models if required.

\subsection{Aspects to Nudge System State}
\label{future_work_using_aspects_to_correct_simulated_state}
\revnote{Title too informal? Can't find a good title for this\ldots{}}

% Relatedly, aspects can represent anticipated future states\inline{rework; it's
% not anticipated future states, it's making long-term predictions based on
% small but discrete changes to existing dynamics, which can be quantised as
% aspects.} to model their potential impact without modifying a known-good model
% of the world today. Future health and economic crises can be constructed as
% prospective changes to a model in an aspect, and applied to investigate the
% possible effects. A potential benefit of this approach as opposed to the
% simple modification of an existing model would be that many potential crises
% can be applied in any combination. For example, 10 aspects representing
% unpredictable future events yield 1024 possible combinations: there are
% \(2^{10}\) possible combinations of these aspects being applied or omitted
% from an execution of a simulation. Work to develop aspect-oriented models of
% speculative futures therefore gives an exponential number of predicted
% futures, which one could analyse to predict possible future trends. With a
% successful proof-of-concept of the augmentation of existing models to
% represent past events, this further step could anticipate future events and
% take advantage of aspect orientation's unique properties as a tool for
% simulation and modelling.

%        solution



\subsection{Hypothesising Possible System Dynamics via Aspects}

% In the above section we claim that we can augment models to keep them relevant
% in the face of unpredictable events; we can also investigate uncertain present
% properties of systems by modelling them in a naive manner and encoding
% hypothesised behaviour as aspects; we can correlate real-world data to
% data produced by aspectually agumented simulations to discover which
% hypothesised system is most similar to the real world. We can also use this as
% a benchmark to judge improvements made by improved hypotheses in the future.

Unpredictable events can cause discrepancies between simulated system state at a
given time and the real-world system it models, as discussed in
\cref{future_work_using_aspects_to_correct_simulated_state}. While this
technique presents promising research opportunities, researchers face other kind
of model uncertainty which aspect orientation could also counter.

In some scenarios, it is difficult or impossible to make predictions about a
system's future states because its dynamics are actively being researched.
Standard scientific practice is to create a model --- mathematical,
computational, or otherwise --- to create synthetic datasets which indicate
accuracy if their predictions align with what is empirically observed.
\inline{Cite popper, any point including studies that do this too? It's fairly
table stakes as a concept\ldots{}} Some aspects of the system under study may be
well-understood.

Rather than creating models of an existing system which encode its hypothesised
behaviour, a naive model can be created which operates as the scientific
consensus understands it. Hypothesised behaviour takes the form of aspects
altering behaviour in any manner the hypothesis requires. Within-style aspects
allow arbitrary modifications, to simulated behaviour, increasing the
flexibility of the technique. Data produced by each model can be compared to
empirically sourced data, and their similarity quantified, as demonstrated in
\cref{chap:exp1_simulation_optimisation} and
\cref{chap:exp2_old_aspects_new_systems}. Our null hypothesis is that the naive
model's similarity to empirically sourced data is greater than that of the
aspectually augmented model; our experiment's hypothesis is that the behavioural
change applied as aspects is more representative of the system under study than
that of the community consensus.

This technique has a satisfying\revnote{Maybe too informal, but I don't know,
maybe live a little\ldots{}?} property: the hypothesis in a given experiment is
clearly described by its aspectual representation, and if an experiment is
successful --- meaning its hypothesised behaviour accurately represents the
real-world system --- then the model adopted in future research as that of the
community consensus can be the aspectually-augmented one produced by the
original study. In this way, the scientific process is directly represented in
the structure of the codebase, and the community's progression to increasingly
accurate models of a system is represented by the progressive adoption of
``patches'' to an original theory.

Hypotheses can also be created compositionally in this model. Researchers might
develop a series of potential system properties or behaviours, but are unable to
investigate all reasonable combinations in a timely manner. However, sets of
aspects representing each can be composed to produce, for $N$ hypothesised
behaviours, $2^N$ potential behaviours which can be compared to empirical
datasets to identify which combination of possible behaviours most closely
resembles that of the real-world system under study. The technique is similar to
modern pharmacutical development, where a series of algorithmically identified
compounds can be produced and tested to identify which are most suitable to
treat a medical issue\inline{find a citation for modern algorithmic / robotic
drug development}, but can be applied to any models where aspectual augmentation
is appropriate.

\revnote{This subsec is already quite long, and including this point makes it
significantly longer. Maybe that's not a prob; maybe this should be a separate
point / subsubsec; maybe it can live in a footnote; maybe it should be omitted
completely.}This technique for developing experimental model codebases has
another desirable property: it unifies seemingly incompatible philosophies of
the scientific process. \citeauthor{kuhn2012structure}~\cite{kuhn2012structure}
explains the scientific process as inherently social: it starts with a paradigm
which is accepted as broadly true, and accumulates an increasing number of
exceptions until the paradigm itself is deemed unfit, and a new basis for a
field's research is adopted.
\citeauthor{popper1972theoryevolution}~\cite{popper1972theoryevolution} explains
the scientific process as an approximation towards truth, with incremental
progress made with each result achieved by a research community. The proposed
technique for developing experimental model codebases demonstrates features of
both. Consider the original model a paradigm initially selected by community
consensus, and the application of aspects Popper's incremental movements toward
truth (as successful experiments are conducted) or Kuhn's exceptions to the
agreed model (as experiments identify weaknesses in the original model). In this
case, each successive new model adopted by a community is adopted in a
Popplarian manner: improvements are objectively measured, incremental, and would
trend towards truth as a model's behaviour fits empirical observations
increasingly closely. However: over a sufficient period of time, the incremental
patching of an original model would produce an accepted community model which
contains a relatively large amount of discovery and complexity encoded in
aspects, as compared to the original model they are applied to. One would expect
the research community to rewrite the base model to simplify future aspect
application and to more elegantly encode recent research findings; effectively
discarding the original paradigm in favour of a new one. This process is Kuhn's
``paradigm shift'', where paradigms are dropped once a generation of researchers
determine that an originally accepted theory on a topic is unfit for purpose as
evidenced by mounting exceptions in the literature; a new paradigm is to be
accepted by the community, as a new base model would have to be written and
adopted.

The relevant philosophy of science is more nuanced than its brief explanation
here, and the suitability of the approach for the development of research
codebases is to be investigated; the work involved is outwith the scope of this
thesis, but is suggested as future work. A basis for the incremental improvement
of models via aspects is effectively demonstrated in
\cref{chap:exp1_simulation_optimisation} and
\cref{chap:exp2_old_aspects_new_systems}, but the feasibility of the approach as
a basis of a community's scientific process and relation to philosophy of
science warrants further investigation.



\subsection{Standards for Model Features}\label{subsec:standard_aosm_techniques}
% The above makes the case that aspects might be shared between different
% research groups' experiments, and also makes the case that models with
% different aspects applied should be comparable. To do that, and to encourage a
% community to blossom, there should be guidelines and/or stnadards around
% developing aspectual model features. 


How can we make a more ``principled'' approach to adopting features for
modelling? PDSF's approach to adding things to a model is powerful and flexible.
A technique that would work for broad applications could allow for a standard in
the RSE community for simulations, at least for sociotechnical simulation. What
are the best practices around the modification of scientific models in this way,
that could encourage collaboration and the sharing of models across groups?




\subsection{FuzziMoss-style libraries of sociotechnical
fuzzers}\label{future_work_revive_fuzzimoss}


% The above makes the case for creating standards for model features, motivated
% by the possibility that aspects can be shared between research groups or
% the application of different aspects applied. A step toward creating that
% standard could be to create a fuzzimoss-style library of either fundamental
% fuzzers, tooling to simplify common fuzzing operations, or…??


We could try to revive FuzziMoss and implement a broader range of behaviourally
varying aspects. The final result of this research might be mis-interpreted as
indicating that this is a non-starter, but standard operations could still be
useful \emph{if not fitted to real-world data and re-used}, providing to
researchers standard variations which are fitted to specific use-cases, or
treated as building blocks to produce more complex models of behavioural
variation, either to apply to a system under study or to validate a theory about
the variation itself.


\subsection{Testing Frameworks to detect Unrealistic Behavioural Variances}\label{sciunits_for_unrealistic_states}

Given we don't know the impact of variances exactly, something like sciunits
could give us "bounds" on realism in our model, i.e. the sciunit should encode
limits on what the real-world system does, and let us know whether those limits
are broken when applying variances (or combinations of them)


\subsection{Optimisation of multiple models}\label{many_aspectual_models_to_optimise}

An explanation of the future work in \cref{subsubsec:ensure_best_move}, where we
suggest that it'd be interesting future work for somebody to anneal to multiple
models of aspectually applied behavioural variance. 

The work to do on this point is relatively trivial --- just a grid search on
many dimensions really --- but we've not done it and it'd risk detracting from
our goal anyway, which is to show that we can optimise a model (so we should
keep things from being unnecessarily complicated!) so worth leaving for an
honours / masters dissertation.




\section{Future Work pertaining to RPGLite}\label{sec:future_work_rpglite}
RPGLite's dataset was analysed for the purposes it was collected for in this
thesis: to aid in the realistic simulation of a well-controlled \sociotechnical
system. However, many analyses are yet to be explored:

\subsection{Causes of Game Abandonment}
Why were games abandoned? Are there patterns that can be identified
which lead players to abandon games?
    
\subsection{Patterns of Play within Cliques of Players}
Players likely formed cliques, where they would play against people they knew
(perhaps in person) rather than relying on RPGLite's matchmaking features to
find new opponents. The existence of cliques of players may have implications
for the playstyles of players, how they learned ``better'' strategies over time,
and the players' general dedication to playing RPGLite (and therefore producing
a greater wealth of data for analysis and dissemination to the community)
    
\subsection{Additional Game Features Driving Engagement}
RPGLite's dataset contains information about players' interactions with the
application itself; as the game made available some features typical of modern
games (leaderboards, matchmaking, achievements, graphical customisation), an
analysis of the features most commonly used can shed light on the more effective
aspects of modern game design in both the general playerbase and more dedicated
players\footnote{For example, are some features heavily used, but only by a
dedicated subset? Do all players use other features a moderate amount, showing
mild but general appeal?}\footnote{Find related research on engagement in mobile
games, which must be \emph{plentiful}.}.
    

\subsection{Larger-scale Data Collection}
RPGLite's playerbase was recruited informally and there is scope for a larger
and longer-term data collection effort to be made. A re-release of the
application in major mobile app stores with a concerted effort to release new
seasons of the game and maintain player interest for an extended period of time
--- perhaps with additional features, such as in-game chat, favourites lists
--of previous opponents, or match replay and analysis (with suggestions for
improved play backed by the formal methods inherant in RPGLite's design) would
enable a richer analysis, and broader utility to the games research community.

While investigations into these questions warrant further study, they remain
outwith the scope of this thesis, which focuses on simulation technologies more
than it does game design. There are many opportunities available for the game
design research community to investigate. Publications in the field from
co-creators of RPGLite reflect further on the design and future improvements of
the game; see \inline{cite William's PhD here}.

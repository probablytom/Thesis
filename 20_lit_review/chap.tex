\chapter{Relevant Literature}

The work presented in this thesis revolves around the combination of simulation
\& modelling and aspect orientation. As discussed, some research on the topic
was also done prior to this body of work~\inline{I assume we discuss PDSF
existing in the intro}. There are therefore several things to discuss: work that
was done on this project prior to this thesis must be discussed so as to make
clear what is \emph{new} in this thesis, related work by others should make
clear the context in which this research was done, and opportunities found in
this related work for which PyDySoFu is well-suited must be identified to set
the scene for the rest of this thesis.

With this in mind, \cref{sec:pdsf_early_work} discusses the earlier work contextualising this
thesis, summarised in \cite{wallis2018caise}. As PyDySofu has some unusual
features as an aspect orientation library, \cref{sec:dynamic_aop_review} follows
this with a review of similar approaches in the literature.
\cref{sec:ao_and_modelling} and \cref{sec:ao_and_simulation} then review aspect
orientation as applied in simulation and modelling respectively, and
\cref{sec:dynamism_in_sm} reviews literature on variable behaviour in simulation
and modelling, a key strength of PyDySoFu. Finally, research opportunities
identified in these various bodies of work are discussed in
\cref{sec:research_opportunities}, which pave the way for the research composing
the body of this thesis.

One notable omission from the set of research themes outlined in
\cref{sec:dynamism_in_sm} is that variations on processes aren't well
studied in their own right. That is to say, behavioural variation is typically
treated as a nuisance to the researcher or practicioner interested in a model or
dataset, and the variations and their impact on simulations are not studied on
their own. Some work exists\inline{cite work that focuses on variations
specifically}, but the majority of this is done in the context of tooling, i.e.
the representation of variation for their use in another research context, where
they are not the subject.

As an aspect orientation framework capable of runtime adaptation of a target
system which can manipulate a join point from inside \inline{what are our
research opportunities given the above...?}

Mostly folk seem to have stuck with AspectJ, and domain-specific / general tooling is reviewed later. I'm reticent to move the specific tech reviewed here because I currently have a nice separation between the philosophy of the paradigm and its implementations; maybe I should make those concepts more clearly separated in section headings, or maybe I should move the tech here and make Criticisms its own section, rather than a subsec of this introduction.}}{41}{Item.2}%

\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }I don't believe I make any note in this section that selecting character pairs based on a known distribution from player data isn't really learning. It's useful, though, because it allows us to demonstrate that using aspects can make us \emph {really} accurate. So, it answers our research question, kind of, in that the aspectually augmented model is more accurate than the naive one. However, that aspect isn't particularly portable to a new system (we'd still be selecting based on the S1 distribution, not S2, so we'd expect it can't be ported) and doesn't so much change simulated behaviour as patch a part of the model. It's still useful to build models of learning, see which players are accurately represented by different models, and see whether those models are portable. I still have to figure out how to ``sell'' this properly\ldots {}}{128}{section.6.4}%

\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }A discussion of how datasets are evaluated. We produce \emph {many} datasets which have annealed to the highest stat and P val we could find, but they're split across many folds. How do we determine whether a set of parameters works ``enough''? We find the highest correlation val and lowest pval which work across a majority of folds, then test against the complete dataset to be absolutely certain that correlation doesn't drop. This gives us the best parameters for a player: the parameters were reliably annealed to across many folds to give statistically significant correlation, retained their correlation against a testing set, and further retained their correlation against the entire dataset.}{149}{subsection.6.6.1}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }Is there a pattern in players getting reliable correlation and having played many games? Maybe we just don't have enough games to do this for most players.

\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }This is an explanation of the analysis script, not the process f annealing; we should already have that in the experimental design section (currently 6.5, at time of writing).}{150}{subsection.6.6.1}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }TODO: add notes explaining what an acceptable pval and correlation stat are. This will be useful to refer back to in the next subsection, where not all players are simulated by each model.}{150}{figure.caption.36}%

\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }I suspect I'll move this to the discussion of the next experiment, so that the aspects using the known distribution are presented as an investigation of the first research question, and the aspects using the confidence-based model of learning are presented as an investigation of the second.}{151}{subsection.6.6.3}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C6{}] todo: }I'm increasingly realising that the aspect drawing from a known distribution is both more accurate and more portable than our models of learning: we can apply it to S2 and just draw from season-specific data to get the correct results. It's actually way better than our models of learning. However, the models of learning let us investigate specific players' behaviour, so they let us use the naive model to investigate the bahviour of real-world players, which is still quite valuable, but might want a different approach to the write-up. I'm pretty lost with this chapter --- need Tim's input, I think.}{151}{subsection.6.6.3}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {[C8{}] todo: }is suitable for simulation purposes?

I have it in KeepIt, Tim sent me some early in the PhD) and an explanation that it's not outside the realm of a normal thesis to make contributions with theoretical implications --- see REST thesis or computational trust --- it does warrant a beefy future work chapter and an exploration of the research this enables (because it \emph {does} enable lots of future research) is a contribution in its own right.

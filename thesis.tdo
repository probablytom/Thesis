I suspect it's included later, because there's a note toward Dynamic Aspect Weaving which suggests the tech needs to come before the criticisms review (i.e. there's some tooling reviewed, but not where it should be). Mostly folk seem to have stuck with AspectJ, and domain-specific / general tooling is reviewed later. I'm reticent to move the specific tech reviewed here because I currently have a nice separation between the philosophy of the paradigm and its implementations; maybe I should make those concepts more clearly separated in section headings, or maybe I should move the tech here and make Criticisms its own section, rather than a subsec of this introduction.}}{31}{Item.2}%

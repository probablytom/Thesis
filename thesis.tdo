\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }Do I need code snippets for notes on aspects?}{89}{section*.7}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }OH NO. I just realised our models don't use birch at all, they use a logistic curve. They also use a relative growth rate on the logicstic curve that I'm unsure of â€” not sure why I implemented it the way I did. Getting increasingly close to just re-running my models. I could run them again using birch, and maybe anneal to a value for the curve shape for different players too...?! THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP.}{90}{section*.9}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }Keeping this in because I might need to explain the aspect, but it's only used in the implementation of choosing based on prior distribution, which I don't believe is ever applied.

\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }Stopped discussing rank correlation here because I may re-run my experiments; if I do, I don't want to have to re-write this, because frankly it's been pretty tricky to write so far and I'm keen not to have to redo it. Maybe there are other correlation metrics we could pick instead; Somers' D looks promisingâ€¦? Are there citations I could use that compare different measurements, so I could justify my choice, and maybe pick one that's better than \tau if it exists?}{97}{subsection.6.5.1}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }Discussion required here around the mitigation of randomness --- it's required because of RPGLite's inherent RNG --- and also explaining how we make use of a grid search in combination with k-fold validation to anneal toward well-fitted parameters of our models of learning for each individual player.}{97}{subsection.6.5.2}%
\contentsline {todo}{\emph {Todo: }is suitable for simulation purposes?

% The context must get across the gap that the paper will fill.
% The first sentence orients the reader by introducing the broader field in
% which the particular research is situated.
% Then this context is narrowed until it lands on the open question that the research answered.
% A successful context section sets the stage for distinguishing the paper's contributions from
% the current state of the art by communicating what is missing in the literature (i.e., the specific gap)
% and why that matters (i.e., the connection between the specific gap and the broader context that the paper opened with).

    % Scientific models are a core component of many fields' research, and the
    % development of those models over time is an important contribution of
    % researchers' work. However, developing these models can be challenging.
    % Models can change over time as scientific consensus shifts, can require
    % reengineering as bugs are discovered, and are subject to requirements other
    % codebases are not: they must meet scientific standards and pass peer review,
    % as well as their outputs. 

    % Aspect-oriented programming is a field (paradigm) where parts of a program
    % which are present in many modules but do not subit to the reqirements of
    % typical modularisation techniques are factored into ``aspects''. Aspects
    % allow cross-cutting concerns to be modularised and ``woven'' into a target
    % codebase. While aspect-oriented programming has seen some academic interest
    % since its original incarnation, it has seen lukewarm industrial adoption and
    % has not been extensively studied as to whether it achieves its claimed
    % benefits in practice. 
    

    % ---

    % \Aop{} is a paradigm which (programming) modularises parts of a program
    % which repeat across many modules but are difficult to refactor into their
    % own module using other techniques. Aspects describe a change (addition) to
    % make to a program and where that change should be introduced; these changes
    % are ``woven'' into the program, in different ways. (Just something to add
    % --- pdsf introduces the idea of a change.) The paradigm has seen some
    % academic interest, but has not achieved widespread industrial adoption, and
    % its claimed benefits to a codebase (originally claimed benefits of improved
    % modularisation and maintainability as a result) have not been demonstrated
    % conclusively in academic literature to date. While the paradigm has been
    % widely studied, its effective use in different scenarios has not been well
    % proven. (Use-cases)

    % This thesis suggests the use of \aop{} in research software engineering
    % (proposes) to take advantage of its ability to add logic to a program,
    % rather than its ability to modularise that program. Research software
    % engineers are tasked with the development of scientific models \&
    % simulations which are subject to requierments most codebases are not: they
    % must produce output which passes peer review, rigorously implement a
    % scientificly interesting (of scientific interest) theory or model, and
    % maintain scientific relevance over time if part of a long-term research
    % project or in the case of community adoption. As a result, these codebases
    % must be maintained over time and demonstrated to work to a research
    % community. We propose that \aop{} fulfils the need of research software
    % engineers to produce models which can be improved over time and maintained
    % in the face of changing research needs by augmenting those codebases with
    % aspects to ``update'' them and retain their relevance.
    
    % ---

    % % AOP can describe changes to points in a program, which was designed to
    % % separate out ``concerns'' of that program but recieved only limited
    % % mainstream / industrial adoption. 
    
    % \Aop{} is a programming paradigm which is designed to separate parts of a
    % program into modules, when those parts do not produce modules [are not
    % easily separated using other means]. The technique describes these parts as
    % aspects: changes to a program (advice) combined with a place to apply that
    % change (a join-point). However, while \aop{} has seen some interest from the
    % academic community [academic interest], it has received lukewarm adoption
    % from industry and its benefits in real-world engineering contexts are not
    % well demonstrated.

    % % We think AOP might be well suited to use in scientific codebases because
    % % models are often used for different things (modelling different scenarios
    % % or hypothetical systems) and are often updated over time (if the research
    % % community's consensus changes or if a model is reused in a new context).
    % % These changes might be well-described as advice. However, people haven't
    % % researched the application of AOP to developing scientific models before.
    % % We want to figure out whether research software engineers can take
    % % advantage of AOP to produce realistic models, by representing changes to
    % % models as advice.
    
    % An alternative use for \aop{} is in producing and maintaining codebases for
    % research purposes. Lots of modern research is conducted with the aid of
    % software models. These models often represent different scenarios in the
    % real world, or require maintenance over time in light of changing consensus
    % in a research community, or are updated to model a new hypothesis when
    % reused in future research projects. In all cases, research software
    % engineers look to describe a change to some foundational model. This raises
    % the possibility that these changes might be well described as aspects.
    % Augmenting models using aspects would allow researchers to concisely
    % describe variations of a model, compare different hypothesised systems, or
    % maintain that model over time without rewriting a delicate, peer-reviewed
    % codebase. However, the application of \aop{} to developing models \&
    % simulations has not been studied to date.

    \Aop{} is a software engineering paradigm used to modularise parts of a
    program which are difficult to separate using other means. The technique
    makes use of aspects, which are changes to a program applied to specific
    parts of that program. While \aop{} has received some academic interest, it
    has seen lukewarm adoption from industry and its benefits in real-world
    engineering contexts are not well demonstrated. \Aop{} is therefore a
    well-studied paradigm which lacks a \emph{raison d'\^etre}.
    
    One possible use for \aop{} is in producing and maintaining codebases for
    research purposes. Modern research is conducted with the aid of software
    models in many fields. These models may represent different possible
    real-world scenarios, require maintenance over time in light of a changing
    scientific consensus, or be updated to represent a new hypothesis when
    reused in future research projects. In all cases, research software
    engineers must describe a change to some foundational model. This raises the
    possibility that those changes could be well described as aspects.
    Augmenting models using aspects would allow researchers to concisely
    describe variations of a model, compare different hypothesised systems, or
    maintain their model over time without rewriting a delicate, peer-reviewed
    codebase. However, \aop{}'s use in research software engineering has not
    been studied to date.

% Methods --- what was done?

    This thesis presents an investigation into the suitability of using \aop{}
    to augment models for research purposes. A new \aspectorientation{}
    framework is implemented, \pdsf{}, which is designed to address the
    requirements of research software engineering. It applies advice using a new
    technique, and introduces new types of advice to better augment pre-existing
    model codebases. The thesis presents a model of people playing a game as a
    case study, which is altered using \pdsf{} to simulate players learning to
    play. To measure whether the model is made more accurate with this addition,
    the game --- RPGLite --- is implemented as a mobile game and distributed to
    real-world players to collect datasets describing their gameplay. Simulated
    players are compared against real-world players to identify whether they are
    accurately represented by the model. By measuring whether the model
    represents gameplay realistically, the thesis illustrates an experiment
    showing that \aop{} can be used to make a model more accurately simulate
    some target system. It proceeds with a second experiment which successfully
    uses advice to add new parameters and behaviours to that model, successfully
    simulating behaviours of individual players using a formalism of learning. A
    third experiment investigates whether aspects can be reused across multiple
    models, and shows that while aspects can be reused successfully, some
    aspectual augmentations are more easily reused than others. 
    
    The thesis contributes an \aspectorientation{} framework suitable for use in
    developing scientific models, as well as a reference system for experiments
    and published the dataset it produced. Aspects are demonstrated to suitably
    encode units of change to a model, introduce significant changes to those
    models, and represent the same changes across different models. We therefore
    conclude that \aop{} applies well to the needs of research software
    engineers. As this invites new research possibilities in many fields, the
    thesis also enumerates the future work these contributions enable for
    researchers whose work concerns \aop{}, simulation \& modelling, and
    research software engineering, and the methodological implications for
    researchers in many fields who encode their hypotheses as software models.

% Regrettably, I haven't had the time to write an acknowledgements section. I'm
% looking forward to adding this as soon as I get chance. I think the
% acknowledgement section of a thesis is a really important thing: it's a place
% where the candidate gets to lay a personal touch an academic document like this
% can have (the only one that's really permitted). The fact that the only personal
% part of a thesis is about \emph{other} people is telling. A PhD isn't something
% anybody does in isolation, and it's important to be aware of how much we owe to
% the folk we're surrounded by.
% 
% I certainly couldn't have produced this without a mammoth amount of help and
% guidance from all sorts of people, often spanning years and years. My name's on
% the paper in some ceremony after all of this is over, but the work they've put
% in has been essential to delivering a complete thesis just the same. If this is
% the only recognition they'll get, isn't it important to shout about their
% support where I can? I really care about paying deference to all those people.
% It takes a village to raise a child because of the time, support, and community
% a baby needs --- that's just as true for a PhD student, and it'd be such a shame
% for all those folk not to get their day in the sun too.
% 
% So, I regret that this still isn't written. With any luck I'll revisit this
% before I submit, but I doubt it. I'll take the time \emph{now} to make the
% content worth examining, and take the time \emph{later} to write up these
% acknowledgements while I wait for my viva.

Regrettably, I haven't had time to write this acknowledgements section. I care
about it and want to do it right --- so I'm saving time to edit the contents of
the thesis, and will write this properly this during the wait for my viva.

abstract = {When using Aspect Oriented Programming in the development of software components,
a developer must understand the program units actually changed by weaving, how they
behave, and possibly correct the aspects used. Support for rapid AOP prototyping and
debugging is therefore crucial in such situations. Rapid prototyping is difficult
with current aspect weaving tools because they do not support dynamic changes. This
paper describes PROSE (PROgrammable extenSions of sErvices), a platform based on Java
which addresses dynamic AOP. Aspects are expressed in the same source language as
the application (Java), and PROSE allows aspects to be woven, unwoven, or replaced
at run-time.},

abstract = {Recent developments in service architectures suggest that run-time adaptations could
be implemented with dynamic AOP. In this paper we discuss application requirements
on run-time AOP support and present a system that addresses these requirements. We
provide basic support for weaving using the Just-In-Time compiler, while the AOP system
is treated as an exchangeable module on top of the basic support. This approach allows
us to provide low run-time overhead, AOP system flexibility, and secure weaving. We
provide an extensive empirical evaluation and discuss the tradeoffs resulting from
using the JIT compiler and a modularized architecture.},

extend and reinterpret its syntax. Maya generalizes macro systems by treating grammar
productions as generic functions, and semantic actions on productions as multimethods
on the corresponding generic functions. Programmers can write new generic functions
(i.e., grammar productions) and new multimethods (i.e., semantic actions), through
which they can extend the grammar of the language and change the semantics of its
syntactic constructs, respectively. Maya's multimethods are compile-time metaprograms
that transform abstract syntax: they execute at program compile-time, because they
are semantic actions executed by the parser. Maya's multimethods can be dispatched
on the syntactic structure of the input, as well as the static, source-level types
of expressions in the input. In this paper we describe what Maya can do and how it
works. We describe how its novel parsing techniques work and how Maya can statically
detect certain kinds of errors, such as code that generates references to free variables.
Finally, to demonstrate Maya's expressiveness, we describe how Maya can be used to
implement the MultiJava language, which was described by Clifton et al. at OOPSLA
2000.},

    abstract = "{The object-process analysis (OPA) methodology combines ideas from object-oriented analysis (OOA) and data flow diagrams (DFD) to model both the structural and procedural aspects of a system in one coherent frame of reference. This is contrary to conventional object-oriented approaches, that use different tools to describe the structure and the behaviour of the system. The underlying observation of the OPA paradigm is that every thing in the universe of interest is either an object or a process, and that a process is not necessarily a method of a single object class. This opens the door for the possibility of modelling systems so that both their structural and procedural relations are represented within the same frame of reference, without suppressing each other. The two major differences between OPA and OOA are OPA's detachment of processes from objects and its recursive scaling capability. The OPA methodology has proven to model faithfully complex systems, such as computer integrated manufacturing, documentation and inspection and an intelligent computer-assisted instruction shell. This work lays down the foundations of OPA. It provides concise definitions of the basic building blocks of the method: objects, processes, classes, features, and the structural and procedural relations among them. The object-process diagram (OPD) is presented as an effective visualization tool that incorporates elements from both DFD and OOA. Due to synergy, both the information content and expressive power of OPD are greater than those of DFD and OOA diagrams combined.}",

abstract="This paper addresses the problem of transforming a process model with an arbitrary topology into an equivalent well-structured process model. While this problem has received significant attention, there is still no full characterization of the class of unstructured process models that can be transformed into well-structured ones, nor an automated method to structure any process model that belongs to this class. This paper fills this gap in the context of acyclic process models. The paper defines a necessary and sufficient condition for an unstructured process model to have an equivalent structured model under fully concurrent bisimulation, as well as a complete structuring method.",

abstract = {Complex systems usually contain design units that are logically related to several
objects in the system. Some examples include: tracing, propagation of interrupts,
multi-object protocols, security enforcement etc. This crosscutting between those
design units and the objects is a natural phenomenon. But, using traditional implementation
techniques, the source code — i.e. the classes — becomes tangled with the implementation
of the crosscutting concerns.AspectJ is an aspect-oriented extension to the Java™
programming language that enables the clean modularization of crosscutting concerns.
Using AspectJ we can encapsulate in program modules (aspects) the implementation of
those design units that would otherwise be spread across the classes.This demo illustrates
what the AspectJ language can do and it shows the tools that support developing programs
with this language. We present an example program, and demonstrate the edit-compile-debug
cycle in an IDE that supports AspectJ.},

abstract = {Chess has served as a convenient vehicle for studying cognition and perception (see de Groot [1965], Chase and Simon [1973]) as well as machine intelligence. Perhaps the central question for both of these research uses of chess is: How much chess-specific knowledge does it take to play at a given level of competence, for example, at the master level? It is difficult to say what chess-specific knowledge is, and it certainly consists of different types of knowledge, that must be considered independently of each other (for example, "book knowledge" obtained by studying chess books is quite different from experience obtained in over-the-board play). Even if one succeeds in defining what "chess-specific knowledge" is, there remains the difficulty of measuring it. Because of these difficulties, any approach to measuring the amount of knowledge possessed by a practitioner of a craft must be based on questionable assumptions, and any result obtained is subject to uncertainty and criticism. Only the inherent interest of the question posed justifies reporting on a rough and inconclusive experiment designed to answer one aspect of the tantalizing question: How much chess-specific knowledge does it take to play at a given level of competence?},

However, the modularity and inheritance characteristics of object-orientation, has posed problems in the area of exception handling in terms of code tangling, repetitive code, and the possibility of spoofed parent classes managing the exception. We propose a method to incorporate parts of aspect-oriented programming, specifically security and exception handling mechanisms, into an object-oriented system in order to increase its modularity and reuse, centralize its security and exception handling, and provide enhanced verification and security of resource access. At the end, a small example is presented to illustrate our approach. Our goal is to eventually develop a methodology and tool to help automate the migration of legacy object-oriented systems to the aspect-oriented paradigm, particularly in regards to exception handling and security.},

An article in BMJ discussing the issues with a 5% threshold on pvalues, arguing
that slightly higher pvals can still be indicitive of effects, and that
statistic coefficients are more important. Basically notes that 5% is arbitrary
and only selected for historical reasons, and that pvalue is not the most
important statistical metric in a trial. It argues that other statistical tools
like confidence intervals are more useful than pvalues.

A survey of metagame literature with a focus on esports. Covers things

it but it seems reasonably thorough! The journal looks a little sketchy but it's
from University of York, and with a little digging, I think it's just small and
low-budget rather than predatory.

Original book on the concept of the metagame. Howard seems to have coined the
term and did the seminal work on metagame analysis. So far as I can tell this is
more game-theoretic and mathematical in nature than the way folk typically use
the term ``metagame'' today; \citet{metagaming_in_esports} is a survey of modern
literature and more contemporary.

The participating codes have proven to be very successful in their own right but they have all been calibrated independently using various observational data sets, stellar models, and merger trees. In this paper, we apply them without recalibration and this leads to a wide variety of predictions for the stellar mass function, specific star formation rates, stellar-to-halo mass ratios, and the abundance of orphan galaxies. The scatter is much larger than seen in previous comparison studies primarily because the codes have been used outside of their native environment within which they are well tested and calibrated. The purpose of the ‘nIFTy comparison of galaxy formation models’ is to bring together as many different galaxy formation modellers as possible and to investigate a common approach to model calibration. This paper provides a unified description for all participating models and presents the initial, uncalibrated comparison as a baseline for our future studies where we will develop a common calibration framework and address the extent to which that reduces the scatter in the model predictions seen here.}",

These codes include smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH), spanning traditional and advanced SPH schemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. Our goal is to study the consistency between simulated clusters modelled with different radiative physical implementations – such as cooling, star formation and thermal active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. We compare images of the cluster at z = 0, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. We find that, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrally concentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of AGN feedback. The scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than for non-radiative runs. Intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have washed away the marked code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen for non-radiative simulations in Sembolini et al.: radiative physics + classic SPH can produce entropy cores, at least in the case of non cool-core clusters. Furthermore, the inclusion/absence of AGN feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellar content – for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and a falling central entropy profile. However, AGN feedback does strongly affect the overall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducing sensibly the stellar fraction.}",

In spite of being considered useful, researchers often complain that industry is not widely adopting AO concepts and technologies in commercial projects.This paper reports on real usage of aspect-orientation in an industrial project, which means that AO, in particular the AspectJ language, is part of a real software product. AO is basically used to overcome several critical problems. Those problems are well motivated and discussed in detail. Some of them are hard to solve with conventional programming techniques whereas the application of an appropriate AO-based solution is very straightforward. Since some of the reported problems are not really of crosscutting nature, the solutions might be questionable. This leads to a discussion about the "political correctness" of this approach. Furthermore, the paper also explains why and how the project management could be convinced to use AspectJ.},

We present an exploration of modelling an example ubiquitous system, the Savannah game, using the mathematical formalism of bigraphs, which are based on a universal process algebra that encapsulates both dynamic and spatial behaviour of autonomous agents that interact and move among each other, or within each other. We establish a modelling approach based on four perspectives on ubiquitous systems—Computational, Physical, Human, and Technology—and explore how these interact with one another. We show how our model explains observed inconsistencies in user trials of Savannah, and then, how formal analysis reveals an incompleteness in design and guides extensions of the model and/or possible system re-design to resolve this.},

An early information theory article (predating Shannon by 20 years, he cites it
in the first page of A Mathematical Theory of Communication) where information
communicated as a series of symbols is discussed. It actually contains the
reasoning behind using the logarithm of the size of the state space a symbol set
creates as the measure of information content. Very cool!

"What we have done then is to take as our practical measure of information the
logarithm of the number of possible symbol sequences." (page 29)

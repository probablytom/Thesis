def analyse_result_file(filepath:str, season:int=1, viability_budget:int=1) -> (str, list[Result], float, float):
    '''
    Analyses results in a file at `filepath` and returnsâ€¦:
        - username
        - all params that are viable for all folds & against the total dataset
        - and the pval threshold at which we find those params
        - the stat threshold at which we find those params.
    viability_budget is the number of pval + stat combinations which yield significant results to return. In other words, when the budget is 1, The first pval + stat combo yielding statistically significant results will be the only one for which results will be returned; if the budget is 2, a second pair will be found before returning; if 3, another still; and so on. A budget of -1 indicates that all results should be returned.

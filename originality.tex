\label{declaration_of_originality}

I certify that the thesis presented here for examination for PhD degree of the
University of Glasgow is solely my own work, other than where I have clearly
indicated that it is the work of others. The thesis has not been edited
by a third party beyond what is permitted by the University's PGR Code of
Practice.
